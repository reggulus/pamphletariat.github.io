orientation: This is a structural argument about what a legal system must be like to count as a rule of law system: it treats law as public, checkable guidance that must let ordinary people determine legality in advance, rather than learning it only after enforcement, delay, or interpretation. It is deliberately not a theory of ideal policy outcomes, a partisan program, or a comprehensive account of moral justice; it does not tell you what the law should *aim* at, only what the law must be able to *state* and *compute* if it is going to coerce. You should trust the frame because it is testable at the level of system behavior (can a person, given the facts and the published rules, determine legality prospectively?), and because it allocates drafting failure costs away from the public: if the state cannot specify and compose its commands determinately, coercion cannot attach.

## 1. The Everyday Problem (Phenomenology)

For ordinary people, legality is often not something they can know in advance. The rules that govern everyday conduct are numerous, layered, and distributed across statutes, regulations, and administrative interpretations. In practice, this means that many people are likely violating multiple rules at any given time—not necessarily because they are malicious, but because the legal surface area is too large to reliably navigate.

As a result, “compliance” frequently becomes less about following clearly knowable rules and more about predicting how the system will behave. People must anticipate not only what the text might mean, but also how it will be interpreted, whether it will be enforced, and how much discretion an official will exercise. The lived experience is that enforcement depends on who is looking, what is being prioritized, and how visible or vulnerable a person is.

In that environment, penalties and prohibitions can come before clarity. Legality is determined in arrears—after an inspection, a complaint, a stop, a denial, or a lawsuit—rather than being something a person can check before acting. Legal uncertainty, delay, and gray zones cease to be exceptional; they become normal operating conditions.

This is corrosive. When everyone is plausibly in violation and enforcement is selective, the law stops functioning as public guidance and starts functioning as discretionary leverage. The core claim of this document follows: a legal system that cannot determine legality in advance—one that makes lawfulness depend on later interpretation, enforcement choice, or delay—is unjust by design.


## 2. The Category Error in Legal Debate

Most legal debate—especially in legal philosophy—fixates on *outcomes*: fairness, rights, and how benefits and burdens should be distributed. But those arguments typically assume that the basic rule-of-law machinery already works: that the system can tell ordinary people, ahead of time, what is lawful and what is not. The poorly addressed, and more foundational, question is what a legal system must satisfy to *qualify* as a Rule of Law system in the first place. If the substrate produces indeterminate legality—if people cannot determine legality in advance because meaning is supplied later by interpretation, enforcement discretion, or delay—then downstream justice analysis becomes incoherent.

You cannot build an edifice without a foundation.


## 3. Rule of Law as a System Property

A legal system is not only the statutes a legislature passes. It is the whole operating corpus that actually governs conduct: statutes together with the regulations, implementing rules, guidance that carries binding effect, and the enforcement structure that makes those rules real in practice. If the day-to-day meaning of “the law” depends on what agencies later invent, or on what enforcement actors supply at runtime, then the system’s coercive power is being exercised by something other than publicly stated rules.

For that reason, **rule of law is a system property**, not a mood, a tradition, or a slogan. It is not satisfied by having courts, or by having written statutes, or by sincere rhetoric about fairness. It is satisfied only when legality is a determinate function of (a) the relevant facts and (b) the system’s enacted, public rules—statutes and regulations together. In such a system, a person who knows the material facts can, in principle, determine whether a contemplated action is lawful before acting.

If legality cannot be determined in advance—if it becomes clear only after an encounter with an agency, an officer, or a judge—then the system has failed at the level that matters. That failure is not merely “hard cases at the margin.” It is evidence that the system is operating with indeterminate rules and is substituting discretion and delay for public guidance.

This also clarifies what courts are for. Courts exist to resolve disputes about facts—what happened, what was intended, what was known, and what the evidence supports—rather than to manufacture the meaning of unclear rules after the fact. When adjudication becomes a routine repair mechanism for vague drafting, the system is no longer applying law; it is improvising it.

A legal system therefore cannot claim the rule-of-law mantle while tolerating rules that cannot be stated unambiguously enough to make legality determinate. If the system cannot specify its obligations and prohibitions in a way that can be known, checked, and applied, then it may still be a regime of power—but it is not rule of law.


## 4. System-Level Requirements for a Just Rule of Law

> These are **global properties** the legal system must satisfy. They describe *what must be true* of the system, independent of how those properties are enforced.

### 4.1 Prospective Knowability

A rule-of-law system must allow ordinary people to know, in advance, whether a planned action is lawful. “Lawful” cannot be a status that becomes clear only after an encounter with an agency, an officer, or a court. That requires laws and regulations that are defined, non-conflicting, and logically composable—so that the legal consequences of conduct are determinable from the text, not manufactured later through interpretation.

Prospective knowability also requires that rules be self-executing in the specific sense relevant here: if the facts are not in dispute, legality (and other legally decisive outcomes) must not depend on discretionary approvals, open-ended standards, interpretive improvisation, or delays that force people to act first and learn later. If a person must guess how an official will read a phrase, weigh a factor, or “apply the spirit,” the system has failed the basic promise that law can guide conduct.

### 4.2 Symmetric Risk Allocation

When drafting is ambiguous, incomplete, or internally inconsistent, the cost of that failure cannot be pushed onto the public. A just system allocates specification risk symmetrically: the state does not get to enforce unclear commands and treat the resulting uncertainty as the citizen’s problem.

In practical terms, uncertainty must block enforcement rather than excuse it. If legality cannot be determined from the available rules and the relevant facts, the system must treat that as a reason not to coerce—not as a license to coerce and litigate meaning afterward.

### 4.3 Bounded Complexity

Even perfectly defined rules can become unusable if the total body of law grows beyond what humans can realistically navigate. A rule-of-law system therefore requires an explicit complexity bound: the legal corpus must remain within human cognitive limits, such that an ordinary person (with accessible tools) can discover and apply the rules that govern their conduct.

This constraint must be structural, not cosmetic. It cannot be measured by raw page or word counts that can be gamed; it must track the real decision structure of the law—its branching conditions, exceptions, and precedence relationships. All statutory and regulatory rules count against this bound, because both function as coercive rules in practice.

**This limit must be a constitutional constraint on statutory and regulatory law; constitutional rights and guarantees precede it and are not counted against the cap.** If the system needs more complexity to legislate a new area, it must pay for it by consolidating, removing, or simplifying elsewhere.

### 4.4 Systemic Protection

These requirements cannot be satisfied by aspiration alone. If they are merely stated, they will be violated in the ordinary course of politics and administration—through delegation, drafting shortcuts, “to be determined” standards, and interpretive improvisation. A system that permits structurally invalid law to be enacted will reliably produce indeterminate legality, no matter how noble its rhetoric.

A just rule-of-law system therefore needs systemic protection built in: a design-time gate that prevents violations from entering the legal corpus in the first place. The point is not to punish bad drafting (or the public) after the fact, but to make structurally invalid law non-passable. Only in this way can coercion never attach to rules that cannot be known, checked, and applied as law.



## 5. The Linter Concept (How the System Enforces Its Own Requirements)

**Purpose of linting:** To mechanically enforce the system-level requirements in Section 4 *before* coercive law exists.

Section 4 describes global properties a legal system must have if it is to count as rule-of-law compatible with justice. Section 5 names the enforcement mechanism that makes those properties real at design time rather than aspirational at runtime: **linting**. The core idea is simple: if a draft rule cannot be stated in a way that makes legality determinate and knowable, then coercion may not attach to it—and the system should prevent it from becoming law in the first place.

### 5.1 What a Linter Is (in plain terms)

In software, a linter is a tool that checks code *before it runs*. It flags structural failures—undefined names, contradictions, impossible branches, and other errors that make the program unreliable or incoherent. The key move is procedural rather than rhetorical: **code that fails the linter does not ship.** The linter is a gate, not a suggestion.

### 5.2 The Legal Analogue

The legal analogue treats proposed laws less like persuasive prose and more like specifications for coercive behavior. A **legal linter** programmatically checks a draft against admissibility rules derived from Section 4—rules that operationalize prospective knowability, symmetric risk allocation, bounded complexity, and systemic protection. If a draft fails those checks, it is rejected as structurally invalid and cannot be considered for passage. And once a proposal clears the gate and becomes law, the governing version is the specification itself: human-readable, but also precise enough to be mechanically checked and (in principle) computer-parsable.

### 5.3 Two Classes of Checks

Not every drafting problem has the same moral and legal status, so linting naturally splits into two categories.
* **Structural lint** is a hard fail: it enforces determinacy, knowability, and bounded complexity, and a violation disqualifies a draft from passage.
* **Style lint** is a soft fail or optional warning: it encodes clarity conventions that make text easier to read and apply but do not change whether legality is determinate.

We are concerned here with **structural lint**.

### 5.4 Illustrative Example: A Lintable vs. Non-Lintable Law

*This example is intentionally simple. Its purpose is not to show that all law can be linted today, but to demonstrate that the distinction between lintable and non-lintable law is real, meaningful, and already visible.*

Consider the following proposed stand-alone natural-language law:

> “It shall be unlawful for minors to loiter in public places after 10 p.m., unless accompanied by a parent or engaged in legitimate activity.”

A structural linter would reject this draft because it cannot determine legality from facts alone. The terms *loiter*, *public places*, and *legitimate activity* are undefined; the scope is unclear because the age cutoff is not specified; and enforcement necessarily depends on runtime judgment by an officer or other official. The result is indeterminate legality: a minor cannot know in advance whether the conduct is lawful.

**Result:** This law fails structural lint. In a just system, it would not be passable.

---

A lintable version can still be written in natural language, but it must be structurally specified:

> “A person under 18 years of age may not remain in a public park, street, or sidewalk between 22:00 and 05:00, unless:
> (a) accompanied by a parent or legal guardian, or
> (b) traveling directly between their residence and a place of employment or a school-sponsored activity.”

This version passes structural lint because the key elements are explicit and checkable: the covered age is specified, the relevant locations are enumerated, the time window is precise, and the exceptions are stated as clear conditions. Nothing requires an officer to supply meaning at runtime; given the facts, legality is determinable.

This example does not argue that the rule is *just*—only that it is *structurally admissible* as law.



## 6. Structural Lint Rules (Admissibility at Passage)

These rules operationalize the system-level requirements in Section 4. A proposed law that fails any rule below is **not passable** and cannot enter the legal corpus.

### 6.1 Defined Terms

Every term used in enforceable rules must be explicitly defined, rather than left to inference, custom, or officer interpretation. Those definitions must be public, non-circular, and versioned, so that a person can determine what the term meant at the time of the alleged conduct and so that later revisions cannot retroactively change the meaning of past obligations.

### 6.2 Determinate Rule Form

Rules must be stateable as explicit condition → outcome structures: if specified conditions obtain, then a specified legal consequence follows. Open-ended standards that require judgment to determine legality—rather than judgment to determine facts—are disallowed, because they relocate the meaning of the rule from the text into discretionary application.

### 6.3 Logical Consistency

A proposed law must not contradict itself or existing admissible law. Any conflict must be resolved before passage through explicit revision, repeal, consolidation, or clearly stated precedence—rather than being delegated to later interpretation, selective enforcement, or judicial repair.

### 6.4 Scope and Precedence Are Explicit

Applicability must be explicit: who is covered, what conduct or state of affairs is covered, and when and where the rule applies. Exceptions must also be explicit, because an unstated exception is functionally an invitation to discretionary enforcement. Where multiple rules could apply, the text must include precedence rules that resolve conflicts deterministically, so that the same facts cannot yield different legal outcomes depending on who is interpreting.

### 6.5 No Discretion in Legal Meaning

The meaning of the law may not depend on runtime judgment. Expert balancing, reasonableness tests, and interpretive latitude may be useful tools for policy argument, but they may not be the mechanism that determines legality, because they convert the law from a public rule into a case-by-case decision.

### 6.6 Immediate Determinability (Once Facts Are Known)

Given the relevant facts, legality must be determinable immediately from the rules as enacted. If a person can know all material facts and still cannot know whether the conduct is lawful—because the rule is vague, incomplete, or depends on later interpretive choices—then the draft produces indeterminate legality and is disqualified from passage.

### 6.7 Self-Executing Structure

The law must operate without discretionary permits, approvals, variances, or waiting periods that make legality contingent on administrative grace. Lawfulness or unlawfulness must be decidable *prima facie* from facts alone; otherwise, people are forced to act first and seek meaning later, which defeats prospective knowability.


## 7. Courts, Juries, and What Still Gets Argued

Linting does not eliminate courts. It changes what courts are *for*. Courts remain the venue for resolving disputed facts and evidence: what happened, what was said, what was known, what was intended, and which witnesses are credible. In a determinate system, the law is a branching structure—if these facts are true, consequence A follows; if different facts are true, consequence B follows. Litigation therefore turns on which factual branch the evidence supports, not on improvising what the rule “really means.”

Judges and juries still exercise human judgment where human judgment is unavoidable: assessing credibility, weighing evidence, determining intent, deciding guilt by the relevant standard, and (where the system allows it) selecting punishments within defined ranges. That discretion is legitimate because it operates on *facts and sentencing choices*, not on the meaning of the law itself.

What a rule-of-law system cannot permit is using adjudication as a repair mechanism for underspecified drafting. Courts may not supply missing definitions, patch contradictions, or reinterpret vague phrases into enforceable commands after the fact. If a statute cannot be applied without a judge inventing a definition, creating an exception, or choosing among incompatible readings, the failure was upstream, at the moment of enactment. That is no longer allowed.

For the same reason, legislative intent, policy goals, or a court’s view of what would be “just” in the abstract cannot be used to override or rewrite the enacted rule. Those considerations belong at drafting time, when the public can see and contest them and when the linter can reject laws that cannot be made determinate. Adjudication is for applying admissible rules to proven facts—not for manufacturing lawful meaning retroactively.

If, despite linting, a rule is found to be a logical problem then it can not be repaired in the judiciary.  It is declared void in it's entirety because allowing judicial repair would reintroduce discretionary meaning after the fact.


## 8. The Novel Capability (Derived): Hypothetical Querying and Safe Harbor

Once a legal corpus is limited to admissible (linted) law—defined terms, explicit scope, determinable condition → consequence rules, and resolved precedence—legality becomes **queryable**. The system no longer treats “is this lawful?” as a question that must wait for an encounter with an officer, an agency, or a court. Instead, it becomes something a person can ask *before acting*, because the rules are structured to yield an answer from facts.

In practice, this means a citizen can describe a planned action in ordinary language and then supply whatever additional facts the rules actually depend on. Where the law branches, the system can ask branching questions (“Are you under 18?”, “Is the location one of the enumerated places?”, “Is the time between 22:00 and 05:00?”, “Does exception (a) apply or (b)?”) and generate an immediate legality determination with a traceable explanation. The output is not an improvised advisory opinion; it is a reasoned report that cites the governing provisions, shows which conditions were satisfied, and identifies which exceptions or precedence rules controlled.

For this to matter as rule-of-law infrastructure, the system must also provide a **safe harbor**: if a person provides true factual inputs and reasonably relies on the system’s legality report, that reliance must provide binding protection. Otherwise “queryability” becomes mere convenience while enforcement remains a trap. A rule-of-law system cannot demand prospective compliance while reserving the right to punish people who acted in good faith on the best official determination available at the time.

This is the practical expression of prospective knowability. Determinacy that exists only in principle—locked behind expert gatekeeping, high fees, delay, or discretionary interpretation—fails its purpose. If ordinary people cannot access legality as a usable answer in advance, then the system has not actually delivered the guiding function that law is supposed to serve.


## 9. What This Framework Does *Not* Decide

This framework is intentionally prior to policy. It does not prescribe substantive outcomes, choose winners between competing ideologies, or tell a legislature what it *should* do—only what the system must be able to *say* and *check* if it is going to coerce people under the name of law.

For the same reason, it does not define fairness, equity, or moral justice. It is a set of structural admissibility constraints: it specifies what must be true for “lawful” and “unlawful” to be determinate categories that can guide conduct in advance.

It also does not eliminate courts, juries, or human judgment. Adjudication remains necessary for resolving disputed facts, credibility, intent, and the application of defined sentencing ranges; what this framework rejects is using judicial interpretation as a repair mechanism for underspecified drafting.

Finally, it does not claim that admissible law is necessarily good law. A rule can be perfectly specified and still be cruel, foolish, or unjust in its aims. Linting is a gate for structural validity, not a guarantee of moral legitimacy.


## 10. Why This Layer Cannot Be Skipped

Every debate about justice—rights, fairness, equality, proportional punishment—quietly assumes something more basic: that the law is determinate enough to be known and followed. If the system cannot tell ordinary people what the rules mean in advance, then arguments about whether the rules are *good* are built on sand. Before we can argue about the moral quality of outcomes, we need a legal substrate where “lawful” and “unlawful” are real categories rather than after-the-fact labels.

When legality is indeterminate, the system does not become neutral; it becomes selective. Uncertainty rewards those with power, influence, endurance, and visibility—people and institutions that can afford teams of experts, can wait out delays, can survive years of process, and can attract attention when discretion is exercised. For everyone else, the “rules” are experienced as shifting terrain: compliance is replaced by risk management, and legality becomes something learned only after enforcement.

**Modern legal systems invert the moral order: punishment is immediate, while clarity is delayed or inaccessible.** People can be fined, arrested, denied permits, or threatened with liability long before they can obtain a reliable, authoritative answer about what the law required. In that environment, discretion and delay do not merely accompany law; they substitute for it. Officials, agencies, and courts become the place where meaning is manufactured, repaired, and negotiated—often case by case, often too late to guide conduct.

This unpredictability is not a technical inconvenience; it is a human constraint. A person cannot plan a business, a family decision, a protest, a building project, or sometimes even a livelihood under a regime where “legal” is a moving target. Planning collapses into caution; creativity collapses into permission-seeking; ordinary life becomes contingent on avoiding attention. Human flourishing requires a stable surface to stand upon.

**Unknowable law functions as coercion without meaningful consent.** If the public cannot determine what the law demands until after the system acts against them, then “compliance” is no longer voluntary adherence to public rules; it is submission to unpredictable force. And a system that relies on discretionary repair by officials—rather than on rules that are complete, explicit, and checkable at the moment of enactment—cannot credibly claim the rule of law. It is, instead, rule by interpretation, rule by exception, and rule by delay.

## Closing Axiom

* **Justice is downstream of rule of law.**
* **Rule of law is downstream of determinacy.**
