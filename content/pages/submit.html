  <h2 id="author-requirements">Author Requirements</h2>
  <p>
    By submitting a pamphlet to Pamphletariat, the author agrees to the following:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>New, original work.</strong>
      The pamphlet is your own original work and has not been previously published elsewhere in substantially the same form.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Pseudonymous publication.</strong>
      Pamphlets are published under a pseudonym. Currently this is your GitHub account name, so this must not be personally identifying.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>No public authorship claims (ongoing).</strong>
      The author will not publicly claim authorship of a specific pamphlet or disclose identifying information that would reasonably allow attribution, now or hereafter.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>GitHub anonymity responsibility.</strong>
      Submission currently occurs via GitHub. The author is responsible for ensuring that their GitHub account, profile, commit metadata, pull requests, comments, and related activity do not reveal their identity, both at the time of submission and in the future. A new, special-purpose, anonymous GitHub account is recommended. Pamphletariat cannot guarantee anonymity beyond the published pamphlet itself.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Exclusive publication license.</strong>
      The author retains copyright but grants Pamphletariat an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual license to publish, reproduce, distribute, and display the pamphlet in any medium or format, now known or later developed, and to sublicense those rights solely as necessary for hosting, archiving, or distribution. This license includes permission to make minor typographic or formatting corrections that do not alter the substance of the argument. The author may not republish the pamphlet elsewhere in substantially the same published form.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Permanence.</strong>
      The author understands that published pamphlets cannot be retracted or substantively modified. Clarifications, revisions, or reversals must be made through a new pamphlet.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    If a submission is not accepted for publication (i.e., the GitHub pull request is closed without merge), no license is granted and the author remains free to publish or use the work elsewhere in any form.
  </p>

  <p>
    Submission via GitHub pull request constitutes agreement to these terms.
